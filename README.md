# blq
stash of more or less random JavaScript code and helpers.
Extracted from various old projects, parts that is generic enough to be usable as libraries.

Som parts use my fork of MochiKit https://github.com/blq/mochikit
(modules not included in default MochiKit is 'base-ext', 'iter-ext', 'random' etc)

Depenencies:
	- jQuery (tested with v2.2.4)
	- MochiKit (my fork)
	- RequireJS (though could be removed.)
	-

todo:
- Not complete - missing parts! extracting from old codebase, splitting files etc.
- Expose code as UMD, not just AMD (or use pure functions and separate shims?)
- describe/include the RequireJS shims settings we need.
- ..
